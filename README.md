## IMPORTANT

Make sure everything is done in the main branch - other branches are experimental, dated, unstable, or all three

### How to run in editor mode:

Once opened in unity, 

1. Open the "Project" window (if this is not present, ctrl+5 should open it)

2. Navigate to Assets > Scenes > Main Menu

3. Double click "Main Menu" to open

4. Press play icon in upper middle of screen

5. The game is good to play!


### How to run game from executable:

1. Navigate to "main" branch

2. Click on "TheLegendOfDave.zip"

3. Download

4. Extract to folder

5. Run "The Legend Of Dave.exe"


### Things to know before running

We did not have time to implement the main menu properly in the build so you currently access it by running into the purple square. We also did not get around to adding a pause menu so if you run from the executable you are stuck in the game until the end of time.
