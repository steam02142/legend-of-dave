# Legend-of-dave

The Legend of Dave is a rouge-like dungeon crawler. The game features random room orders, multiple enemies, and a boss (after level 25). There is also a currency system which allows the player to get upgrades after each death.

## IMPORTANT

### Things to know before running

We did not have time to implement the main menu properly in the build so you currently access it by running into the purple square. If you access this menu mid run it will delete your progress. We also did not get around to adding a pause menu so if you run from the executable you are stuck in the game until the end of time. Art was not added yet for the portals so we have white triangles that are there as placeholders.
